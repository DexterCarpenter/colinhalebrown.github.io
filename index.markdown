  <div class="Content">During the flight at Spaceport America the rocket lost the motor due to a gas leak. The rocket flew to only 5000ft before returning to the ground balistic. While this was an unoptimal outcome I could not be more proud the team and everything we acomplished. Our technical report scored well and our engineering was sound. Thank you to all the everyone who spent weekends and late nights to make this dream come true. I couldn't have asked for a better team, your dedication and percerverence was inspiring.

  <div class="Title"><h2>Burl Mini</h2></div>
  <div class="Content">The goal of the project was to deliver a Wi-Fi capable air sensing module. With it able to monitor gas concentrations and air quality for uses in indoor farming and air monitoring. Be competitive on functionality while adding modern, user focused features. This incolved adding USB-C for power and debugging, MicroSD for data logging and configuration, and user swapable battery. 
  <br>
  I focused more on the user experience and making a polished product with the project while trying to minimize the number of parts onboard. To keeping the system safe the enclosure lid snaps in place covering the sensors and MicroSD slot from damage durring operation. The base is equipt with mountign holes and slots for various mounting options.</div>

  <div class="Content">The goal of the MISO Data Logger was to make a comparable product to industrial underwater sensors while making the sensors modular. The modular I2C Sensor Cap is interchangeable with any I2C capable sensor setup. The MISO logger is equipt with an I2C sensor Input, Real Time Clock (RTC), MicroSD card for config and data storage, magnetic interrupts, and is powered with a standard 18650 battery for easy maintinence.</div>

  <div class="Title"><h2>Keyboards</h2></div>
  <div class="Content">I went down the rabbit hole of custom keyboards and could not find a keyboard that I liked, I ended up designing two keyboards, the Berm and the Split. The Berm is a 65% low profile ortholinear keyboard with separated halves. The split takes everything I liked about the Berm to the extreme. Lowering the keys by 10mm, adding a proper enclosure, and fully splitting the keyboard in half. With the goal of making the same base PCB for each half and populating different components to get a different side.</div>
